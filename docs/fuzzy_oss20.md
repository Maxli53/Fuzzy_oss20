##### Decision Rationale (Research-Supported)

**Why These Parameters Were Chosen:**

1. **60-Period Rolling Window**: Research shows that rolling window size should depend on sample size and periodicity, with longer windows yielding smoother estimates. 60 periods provides ~3 months of daily data, balancing responsiveness with stability.

2. **±2 Standard Deviations**: Studies demonstrate that statistical boundary calculation using standard deviations outperforms arbitrary fixed ranges. 2σ covers ~95% of observations while maintaining meaningful fuzzy distinctions.

3. **ATR-Based Thresholds**: Financial research validates that volatility-adaptive parameters improve forecasting accuracy compared to fixed percentage thresholds. ATR(20) provides instrument-agnostic volatility measurement.

4. **2.0 × ATR Multiplier**: Empirically tested multiplier that requires significant moves (beyond normal volatility) to trigger "sharply" classifications while remaining sensitive to meaningful changes.

5. **Triangular Membership Functions**: Research shows triangular functions provide optimal balance between computational efficiency and interpretability for financial applications.

6. **Daily Recalibration**: Studies confirm that adaptive models with dynamic parameter updates enhance model stability while maintaining sensitivity to market changes.# Financial Story-Based LLM Architecture
## A Comprehensive 10-Stage Framework for Market Narrative Generation and Prediction

### Executive Summary

This document outlines a novel 10-stage architecture for financial market prediction using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach leverages Fuzzy Pattern Recognizer (FPR) and Fuzzy Sets (FS) methodologies to convert raw market data into coherent financial narratives, which are then used to fine-tune an LLM for market story continuation and prediction.

**Core Innovation**: Rather than teaching an LLM to understand raw financial data, we teach it to understand and continue market stories - leveraging the LLM's natural language processing strengths while preserving financial domain expertise through systematic fuzzification and story assembly processes.

        'price_data': ohlcv_bars,
        'technical_indicators': rsi_macd_etc,
        'market_internals': breadth_indicators,
        'volatility_data': vix_surfaces
    },
    'discrete_series': {
        'news_events': article_publications,
        'corporate_actions': earnings_dividends,
        'economic_releases': gdp_employment_etc,
        'market_structure': halts_circuit_breakers
    }

### Output to Stage 2
Temporally aligned, multi-modal dataset with clear separation between continuous and discrete time series, ready for fuzzification processing.

---

## Stage 2: Fuzzification Engine

### Purpose
Transform raw market data into structured narrative components using Fuzzy Sets for continuous series and specialized processing for discrete series.

### Processing Framework

#### Continuous Time Series Processing (FS + FPR)

##### Fuzzy Sets Component
**Applicability**: All continuous time series where overlapping membership functions are meaningful:
- Price series (OHLCV)
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages) 
- Market internals (TICK, TRIN, VIX)
- Volume measurements
- Volatility indicators
- Interest rates and yield curves

**Five-State Classification System**:
```
State Levels:
1. very low
2. low  
3. medium
4. high
5. very high

Membership Values: 0.0 to 1.0 for each applicable state
Overlapping: Indicators can have membership in multiple states simultaneously
```

**Example Transformation**:
```
Raw Data Input:
- RSI: 67.3
- Volume: 1.4x average
- VIX: 18.2
- TICK: +650

Fuzzy Sets Output:
- Momentum: high (0.7), very high (0.3)
- Volume: high (0.8), very high (0.2)
- Volatility: low (0.6), medium (0.4)
- Breadth: high (0.9), very high (0.1)
```

##### Fuzzy Pattern Recognizer Component
**Primary Function**: Generate temporal narrative descriptions for ALL continuous time series:

**FPR Processing Framework**:
1. **Segment Definition**: Divide continuous time series into overlapping time segments
2. **Movement Classification**: Categorize each segment using five-state system:
   - rises_sharply (+2)
   - rises (+1) 
   - remains_steady (0)
   - drops (-1)
   - drops_sharply (-2)
3. **Pattern Sequence Generation**: Create temporal narrative sequences
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Provide fuzzy match strength (0.0 to 1.0)

**Temporal Narrative Examples**:
```
Price Series Analysis:
Sequence: [+1, 0, +2] 
Narrative: "Price rose moderately, then consolidated, then surged sharply"

Volume Series Analysis: 
Sequence: [+2, -1, +1]
Narrative: "Volume spiked initially, then declined, then recovered moderately"

RSI Series Analysis:
Sequence: [-2, 0, +1]
Narrative: "Momentum collapsed sharply, then stabilized, then began recovering"
```

**Secondary Function**: Pattern library system for known market behaviors:
```
Classic Technical Patterns:
- "Bullish Reversal": [-2, 0, +2] → "dropped sharply, consolidated, then surged"
- "Momentum Continuation": [+1, 0, +2] → "rose, consolidated, then accelerated" 
- "Bearish Breakdown": [0, 0, -2] → "consolidated, then collapsed sharply"
```

#### Discrete Time Series Processing

**Characteristics**: Event-driven data that cannot meaningfully use FS+FPR:
- Non-overlapping categories (no fuzzy membership)
- Temporal gaps and irregular timing
- Binary or categorical classifications

**Main Types and Processing**:

##### News and Sentiment Events
```
Processing Approach:
- Event frequency analysis ("3 positive articles in past hour")
- Sentiment trend tracking ("sentiment shifted from neutral to positive")
- Event clustering ("earnings-related news surge")
- Recency weighting ("recent positive momentum in news flow")
```

##### Corporate Actions and Announcements
```
Processing Approach:
- Event cataloging and classification
- Time-to-event analysis ("earnings in 3 days")
- Event impact assessment ("post-earnings reaction")
- Event clustering ("dividend season concentration")
```

##### Economic Releases and Calendar Events
```
Processing Approach:
- Release schedule tracking
- Surprise factor analysis (actual vs. expected)
- Historical reaction patterns
- Market positioning before releases
```

##### Market Structure Events
```
Processing Approach:
- Event flagging and timing
- Market regime classification
- Structural impact assessment
- Operational constraint identification
```

### Output to Stage 3
Structured narrative components with:
- Formal fuzzy state classifications for continuous series
- Temporal narrative descriptions for continuous series
- Event-based analysis for discrete series
- Confidence levels and temporal context for all components

---

## Stage 3: Story Assembly Engine

### Purpose
Combine narrative components from the Fuzzification Engine into coherent, comprehensive market stories that integrate both continuous and discrete insights.

### Multi-Modal Integration Framework

#### Integration Process
1. **Continuous Data Synthesis**: Combine FS states and FPR narratives
2. **Discrete Event Integration**: Incorporate event analysis and context
3. **Cross-Modal Coherence**: Ensure logical consistency between data types
4. **Temporal Alignment**: Maintain proper time relationships
5. **Narrative Flow**: Create natural language progression

#### Story Component Architecture
```
Story Structure:
1. Market Direction Context (from price FPR + FS)
2. Participation Analysis (from volume FPR + FS) 
3. Technical Environment (from indicators FPR + FS)
4. Event Context (from discrete processing)
5. Risk Assessment (multi-modal synthesis)
6. Forward-Looking Context (pattern implications)
```

#### Enhanced Story Assembly Example
```
Input Components:
- Price FPR: "rose moderately, then accelerated sharply" 
- Volume FS: high (0.8), very high (0.2)
- VIX FS: low (0.6), medium (0.4)
- RSI FPR: "climbed steadily, then surged"
- News Events: "Three positive earnings announcements in past hour"
- Calendar: "Fed meeting approaching in 2 days"

Assembled Story Output:
"The S&P 500 demonstrated clear momentum acceleration today, with price 
action following a classic continuation pattern as it rose moderately 
through the morning session before accelerating sharply into the close. 
Volume analysis supports this move with elevated participation suggesting 
institutional accumulation rather than retail speculation.

From a technical perspective, momentum indicators have climbed steadily 
before surging in the final hour, while the volatility environment 
remains constructive with VIX holding in low territory. This backdrop 
has been supported by a positive fundamental catalyst, as three earnings 
announcements exceeded expectations during the session.

Looking ahead, the approaching Fed meeting in two days introduces a 
key event risk that could either validate the current momentum or 
create volatility if policy guidance disappoints. Key resistance at 
4,200 will be critical to monitor for continuation signals."
```

### Quality Assurance Framework
- **Logical Consistency**: Ensure narrative components don't contradict
- **Temporal Coherence**: Maintain proper time sequence relationships
- **Completeness Checking**: Verify all major market dimensions are covered
- **Clarity Optimization**: Ensure trader readability and actionability

### Output to Stage 4
Complete, coherent market narratives in natural language that integrate all available market intelligence while maintaining logical flow and readability.

---

## Stage 4: Tokenization Engine

### Purpose
Convert natural language market stories into token sequences suitable for LLM training and inference using standard language model tokenization approaches.

### Tokenization Strategy

#### Standard LLM Tokenization Approach
- **Method**: BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) or WordPiece tokenization
- **Rationale**: Leverages pre-trained language understanding from base model
- **Advantage**: Financial knowledge embedded in story content, not token structure

#### Tokenization Process
```python
# Conceptual tokenization flow
market_story = """The S&P 500 demonstrated clear momentum acceleration today, 
with price action following a classic continuation pattern..."""

# Standard tokenization (not custom financial tokens)
tokenized_sequence = tokenizer.encode(market_story)
# Output: [1847, 9234, 5671, 2890, ...] - standard BPE tokens

# Financial meaning preserved in narrative content, not token IDs
```

#### Context Window Management
- **Sequence Length**: Optimize for model's context window (typically 2048+ tokens)
- **Story Chunking**: Break longer stories into coherent segments if needed
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain narrative coherence across token boundaries

#### Training Sequence Preparation
```python
# Multi-day story sequences for training
training_sequence = {
    'input_tokens': [
        tokenize("Day 1: Markets opened lower on inflation concerns..."),
        tokenize("Day 2: Selling pressure continued but showed exhaustion..."), 
        tokenize("Day 3: Reversal signals emerged on oversold conditions...")
    ],
    'target_tokens': tokenize("Day 4: Follow-through buying confirmed reversal...")
}
```

### Special Tokenization Considerations

#### Market-Specific Token Handling
- **Numbers and Percentages**: Ensure consistent representation
- **Financial Terms**: Leverage pre-trained model's existing financial vocabulary
- **Temporal References**: Maintain clarity in time-based relationships
- **Technical Terms**: Preserve meaning of indicators and patterns

#### Sequence Boundary Management
- **Story Separators**: Clear delineation between daily narratives
- **Context Tokens**: Special tokens for temporal transitions
- **Attention Masks**: Proper handling of variable-length sequences

### Output to Stage 5
Tokenized sequences ready for LLM training/inference that preserve the narrative content and structure while conforming to model input requirements.

        "Day N-4: Oversold conditions emerged but no reversal signals...",
        "Day N-3: First signs of stabilization appeared with volume...",
        "Day N-2: Tentative recovery attempt gained momentum as...",
        "Day N-1: Confirmation signals strengthened with broad participation..."
    ],
    'target_story': "Day N: Follow-through rally materialized as predicted..."
}
```

recent_context = get_last_n_stories(n=7)  # One week context
tokenized_input = tokenizer(recent_context)

# Generate next-day story prediction
prediction = model.generate(
    tokenized_input,
    max_length=512,
    temperature=0.7,
    do_sample=True,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
)

next_day_story = tokenizer.decode(prediction)
```

## Conclusion

This 10-stage architecture provides a comprehensive framework for building a story-based financial prediction system that leverages both traditional financial analysis expertise and modern large language model capabilities. The modular design ensures each component can be developed, tested, and optimized independently while maintaining clear interfaces for integration.

The approach addresses the fundamental challenge of bridging quantitative financial data with natural language understanding by using fuzzy logic methodologies to create meaningful narrative components that preserve financial semantics throughout the pipeline.

Success will depend on careful implementation of each stage, rigorous testing and validation, and continuous feedback integration to ensure the system adapts and improves based on real market performance. The separation of financial expertise (in early stages) from narrative learning (in the LLM) allows for optimal utilization of both domain knowledge and artificial intelligence capabilities.

This architecture serves as both a technical blueprint and a development roadmap, providing clear guidance for implementation while maintaining the flexibility to adapt and improve as market conditions evolve and new technologies become available.
